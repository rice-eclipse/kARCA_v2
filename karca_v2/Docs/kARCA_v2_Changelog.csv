Intended Change,Updates
Add a transistor for the heartbeat light (Pi can't supply enough current),Added PN222A BJT to control  HBT LED
Remove +10V rail altogether,Done. Power plane only has 5V. 12V supplied through traces
Fix PT feedback,Replaced LM324 Op-Amp with the TLV9301 Rail-to-rail op-amp
Find better supplier for lever terminal blocks,Wago 2604 series
Add more test pads,58 total test points
Add a ground test pad,Done
"Figure out how to deal with high thermal mass, maybe by making the thermal reliefs thinner?",Replaced LDO with low-noise switching regulator module to reduce power dissipation
Reverse the reversed power switch footprints,Done
Remove the unnecessary third ADC,Done
Think about yellow vs. white LEDs for driver actuation indicator,Replace yellow with green LED
"Switch mounting holes to #6 screws instead of #4, and make sure they line up with the box pitch",Done
Add explicit ports for strain gauges??,
Redo wiring so GND is pin 1 on XLR connectors (backwards compatibility with Mk1.1 is no longer needed),
Fix LC silkscreen labels,
Add a fuse or breaker for the main battery,Added 10A fuse
"Implement adjustable LC gain, maybe just a selector switch?",Added a selection jumper.  May need to replace fixed resistors with Varistors to modify gain after calibration
Make layout tweaks for soldering iron accessibility?,
Fix inamp feedback circuit,Replaced MCP6N11 in-amp with AD8223 in-amp for higher Gain-bandwidth product
Replace LPFs with rail-to-rail opamps,Replaced LM324s with TLV9301
"Try to find the source of the short on kARCA v1, and fix it on new version",Revised power distribution entirely
Continuity detection for valve drivers,INA180 Current sense amplifier to monitor driver current
Continuity detection for ignition driver,Test continuity using a small test current
Battery voltage readout,Done. Used a voltage divider with buffer
Driver current sensors?,INA180 Current sense amplifier
Main power input current sensor,Done. Used INA180 current-sense amplifier
Add a real-time clock,
Make second LC amplifier add reference voltage instead of first,
Maybe add onboard thermocouple amplification?,Done
Change PT amplification circuit to use full scale?,Modified shunt resistor to 30 ohms and PT gain to 8. (Res = 0.31psi)
Add insertable jumper/keyhole for arming ignition?,Done
Put buzzer on the board?,Done
"Fix 5-pin XLR wiring colors (green should be ground), and pin 1 should always be ground",
"Figure out why 10V regulator didn't work, definitely get rid of it if we can't",Removed it
Add unity-gain amps on the shunt values in order to prevent the impedance of the amplifier from letting current leak in from the PT,Added TLV930x amps as a buffer between the shunt and active filter
Switch to XT30s for outside power connectors?,
Get a smaller box?,
Switch to an inamp which JLC has in-stock so we don't have to solder any SMD components,AD8223 is in stock
"""The pressure transducer amplifier spiked periodically. Removing the anti-aliasing capacitors fixed this. My current guess is that the capacitors were small enough to induce oscillations caused by the slew rate of the opamp""",Switched to an op-amp with 3V/us slew rate (the old one had a 0.5V/us slew rate)
,
Other Changes,
Replaced FQP30N06  MOS with IRF3708 mos (<30mOhm Rds @ Vgs of 2.8V so it can be turned on by the Pi GPIO directly),
"Reduced cutoff frequency to 1.5kHz to ensure sufficient nose attenuation at 5kHz, while providing sufficient bandwidth for 1 sample/second",
