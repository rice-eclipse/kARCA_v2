# kARCA 2.0
kARCA 2.0 is a revision of [kARCA](https://github.com/rice-eclipse/karca):  Rice Eclipse's Engine Control System PCB for the data collection and remote control 
of their Titan II and Proxima Hybrid Rocket Motors

In addition, various components have been replaced for updated ICs and the power regulation and load cell circuits have been revised.
