# kARCA 2.0
kARCA 2.0 is a revision of [kARCA](https://github.com/rice-eclipse/karca):  Rice Eclipse's Engine Control System PCB for the data collection and remote control 
of their Titan II and Proxima Hybrid Rocket Motors

It performs the same functions as kARCA with the addition of thermocouple data collection, driver current monitoring, and battery monitoring.
In addition, various components have been replaced for updated ICs and the power regulation and load cell circuits have been revised.

A detailed description of the changes can be found on  [karca_v2/Docs/changelog](https://github.com/rice-eclipse/kARCA_v2/blob/main/karca_v2/Docs/kARCA_v2_Changelog.csv)
